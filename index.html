            A finance professional who is curious about technology. 
            <br><br><br>
            After graduated from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champain with an accounting and finance degree, I began working in the financial industry at the Bay Area. With the huge exposure to technology companies in Sillicon Valley, my interest and curiousity in the area also grew. I began reading and learning more and more about new technologies and the envinronment in general. 
            <br><br><br>
            With years of experience in the finance industry, I saw the many deficiencies in business operations. I hope to learn about ways to improve efficiency and provide a better product using my expertise in finance and software.
